# Wine_Clustering Operations

## Overview

This notebook contains Python code to perform various matrix operations, initialize random weights, and calculate cluster separations using centroids. The code is designed to facilitate clustering or optimization tasks involving matrices, centroids, and weight calculations.

## Structure

### 1. **matrix Class**
   - **Purpose:** To initialize and handle 2D arrays (matrices), either from a file or passed directly as an argument.
   - **Constructor Arguments:**
     - `filename`: The name of the file containing matrix data (optional).
     - `array_2d`: A NumPy array to initialize the matrix (optional).
   
### 2. **Functions**

- **get_initial_weights(m):**
  - Generates random initial weights for a matrix of size `m`.
  - The weights are normalized to sum to 1.

- **get_centroids(data, S, K):**
  - Calculates centroids for the given data, based on `S` (likely the cluster assignment) and `K` (the number of clusters).

- **get_separation_between(data, centroids, S, K):**
  - Computes the separation between clusters, measuring the distance between centroids and the data points.

- **get_new_weights(data, centroids, old_weights, S, K):**
  - Updates the weights using the within-cluster and between-cluster separation metrics.

### 3. **run_test():**
   - A function designed to test the various clustering-related functionalities defined in the notebook.

## Usage

- Ensure all required libraries (NumPy) are installed: `pip install numpy`.
- The functions and class are set up to handle clustering problems involving weights and centroids.
- Modify the test cases in `run_test()` to test specific datasets or configurations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
